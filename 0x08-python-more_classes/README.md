## What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model real-world entities and their interactions. It organizes code into classes and objects, which promote modularity, reusability, and abstraction.

## "First-Class Everything"

In Python, everything is considered an object. This means that functions, classes, and data structures can be manipulated, passed as arguments, and stored in variables, just like any other objects.

## What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. Classes encapsulate data and behavior.

## What is an Object and an Instance?

An object is a specific instance of a class, created from the class blueprint. It represents a unique entity with its own set of data and methods.

## Difference Between a Class and an Object or Instance

A class is the blueprint, while an object or instance is a specific realization of that blueprint. Classes define the structure, and objects represent instances of that structure.

## What is an Attribute?

An attribute is a variable associated with a class or object. It represents data that an object holds. Attributes can be accessed and modified.

## Public, Protected, and Private Attributes

In Python, attributes can be public (accessible from anywhere), protected (accessible within the class and its subclasses), or private (accessible only within the class). They are defined using naming conventions, e.g., `_protected` and `__private`.

## The `self` Keyword

`self` is a reference to the instance of a class, allowing you to access and modify instance attributes and methods. It's the first parameter in class methods.

## What is a Method?

A method is a function defined within a class, representing the behavior or actions that objects of that class can perform.

## The Special `__init__` Method

`__init__` is a constructor method used to initialize object attributes when an instance of the class is created.

## Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding

- Data Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user.
- Data Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a class.
- Information Hiding: Restricting direct access to some details of an object, typically by making attributes private.

## What is a Property?

A property is a special kind of attribute that is accessed and modified using methods (getter and setter), providing control over attribute access.

## Difference Between an Attribute and a Property in Python

Attributes are accessed directly, while properties use getter and setter methods to control access and modification.

## Pythonic Way to Write Getters and Setters

Use `@property` for getters and `@<attribute>.setter` for setters, allowing you to define property-like access to attributes.

## The Special `__str__` and `__repr__` Methods

- `__str__`: Returns a human-readable string representation of the object.
- `__repr__`: Returns an unambiguous and informative string representation used for debugging.

## Difference Between `__str__` and `__repr__

`__str__` is for end-users, `__repr__` is for developers. `__repr__` should ideally provide information to recreate the object.

## Class Attribute

A class attribute is shared among all instances of a class. It's defined within the class but outside of any methods.

## Difference Between an Object Attribute and a Class Attribute

Object attributes are specific to an instance, while class attributes are shared among all instances of a class.

## Class Method

A class method is a method that is bound to the class, not the instance. It can access and modify class attributes.

## Static Method

A static method is a method that is defined within a class but does not depend on the class or instance. It's primarily used for utility functions.

## Dynamically Creating New Attributes

You can dynamically add new attributes to instances using dot notation or by directly modifying the `__dict__` attribute.

## Binding Attributes to Objects and Classes

Attributes can be bound to objects or classes by defining them within the class or by assigning them directly to the object.

## The `__dict__` Attribute

The `__dict__` attribute is a dictionary that contains all attributes of a class or instance, allowing you to access and modify attributes dynamically.

## Finding Attributes in Python

Python searches for attributes in the following order: instance, class, superclass (if applicable). If not found, it raises an `AttributeError`.

## Using the `getattr` Function

The `getattr` function allows you to dynamically access attributes by name, providing a default value if the attribute does not exist.
